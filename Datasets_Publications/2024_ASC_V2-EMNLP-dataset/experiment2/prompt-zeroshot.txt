task_description = """
You are tasked with annotating English argument structure constructions (ASCs) in sentences.
Your role is to assign one of seven different ASC labels to verbs that form ASCs in each sentence:
(1) transitive simple (TRAN_S),
(2) transitive resultative (TRAN_RES),
(3) caused-motion (CAUS_MOT),
(4) intransitive simple (INTRAN_S),
(5) intransitive motion (INTRAN_MOT),
(6) intransitive resultative (INTRAN_RES),
(7) ditransitive (DITRAN).
Tag only the labels. Note that a sentence may contain multiple ASCs
Please format your annotations in a simplified CoNLL-U format. For each word in the sentence, list its order number, the word itself, and its label if it is a verb participating in an ASC; otherwise, use an underscore (_). Example:
# text = John throws the ball.
1\tJohn\t_
2\tthrows\t[tag a label]
3\tthe\t_
4\tball\t_
5\t.\t_

Please annotate the following sentence:
