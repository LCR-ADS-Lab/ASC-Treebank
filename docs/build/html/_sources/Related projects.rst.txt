We build on previous related projects to create a publicly available treebank of ASCs. Below is a brief summary of the projects.

-----
PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005)
-----
* Identified and labeled the semantic arguments on the verb (verb-based)
* Tagsets (for more information, see Bonial, Babko-Malaya, Choi, Hwang, & Palmer, 2010)
::

  Arg0: PROTO-AGENT
  Arg1: PROTO-PATIENT
  Arg2: benefactive, instrument, attribute
  Arg3: the starting point, benefactive, instrument, Attributive
  Arg4: end point
  ArgM-: (includes a number of non-numbered arguments such as TMP, LOC, GOL, etc.)

-----
FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003)
-----
* Identified and labeled frame elements (similar to semantic roles) mostly based on a verb
* Frame elements: less verb specific, but defined in terms of overall semantic structures (i.e., frames) evoked by the verb; one or more verbs can be associated with a single semantic frame (Hwang, Nielsen, & Palmer, 2010)
* See also https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/ 

-----
VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005)
-----
* Demonstrated more specific semantic classes of verbs
* Grouped similar verbs that have similar syntactic realization (frames) (based on Levin, 1993)

-----
Universal Proposition Banks (Akbik et al., 2015)
-----
* Annotated text in different languages with universal semantic role labelling annotations.
* Used the frame and role labels of the English PropBank
* See also https://universalpropositions.github.io/
