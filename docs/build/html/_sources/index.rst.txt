ASC annotation project 
===================================

.. note::

   This project is under active development.


In cognitive linguistics, a construction represents a form-meaning pair. Constructions can exist at the syntactic/lexicogrammatical level, wherein a verb and its argument structure constitute a form that corresponds to a propositional meaning (e.g., Diessel, 2004; Fillmore, Kay, & Oâ€™Connor, 1988; Goldberg, 1995, 2003, 2006; Jackendoff, 2002). These constructions are referred to as **argument structure constructions (ASCs)**. The current project represents the construction of a gold-standard annotated treebank of ASCs and a transformer-based model to tag ASCs.


**ðŸ¤— Our demo based on the transformer-based model** is currently available `here`_.
