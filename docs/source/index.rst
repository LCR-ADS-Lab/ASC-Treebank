ASC-Treebank Documentation 
===================================

In cognitive linguistics, a construction represents a form-meaning pair. Constructions can exist at the syntactic/lexicogrammatical level, wherein a verb and its argument structure constitute a form that corresponds to a propositional meaning (e.g., Diessel, 2004; Fillmore, Kay, & O’Connor, 1988; Goldberg, 1995, 2003, 2006; Jackendoff, 2002). These constructions are referred to as **argument structure constructions (ASCs)**. The current project represents the construction of a gold-standard annotated treebank of ASCs, which was used to train a Spacy transformer model that annotates ASCs with a high degree of accuracy (F1 = .918). The annotation model (including a demo) is available here.

✅ The annotation model (including a **demo**) is currently available `here`_.
