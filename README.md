# ASC-Treebank
This is the repository for the Argument Structure Construction (ASC) Treebank

The ASC Treebank was used to train a Spacy transformer model that annotates ASCs with a high degree of accuracy (F1 = .918). The annotation model (including a demo) is available [here](https://huggingface.co/kriskyle/en_pipeline).

If you use the model or the treebank, please cite this paper (*will be updated*):
